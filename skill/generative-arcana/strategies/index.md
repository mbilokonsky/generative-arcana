# Strategy Registry

The orchestrator reads this in Stage 0 to build the per-stage generation plan. Each row: the stage, the method, when it's right, the file. Strategies generate an axis's *inputs*; they defer to `references/schema.md` for output shape and `references/integration.md` for the card pass.

The **transversal is always on** (the choice is which one). The **prime/composite axis is always on too** — its factorization is derived from the number, but its **gloss is authored on every major** (and optionally on each rank); a gloss that won't cohere is signal the slot is miscast. The prime-leaning strategies below merely make it *load-bearing* rather than a quiet undertone.

## Suits — Stage 1 (grid axis, fixed order)

| Method | Best when | File |
|---|---|---|
| dialectical | The theme has no obvious four-fold structure; derive suits from its deepest tensions. The default. | `suits/dialectical.md` |
| manual | The theme already supplies four natural categories (elements/houses/seasons/nations). | `suits/manual.md` |

## Transversal — Stage 2 (substrate axis, required, before majors)

| Method | Best when | File |
|---|---|---|
| chaldean | Esoteric/astrological/classical themes where the seven planets in Chaldean order are the right substrate. | `transversal/chaldean.md` |
| themed_cycle | Any theme with its own canonically-ordered cycle. The general case. | `transversal/themed_cycle.md` |

## Majors — Stage 3 (22 cards built directly; no rank layer)

| Method | Best when | File |
|---|---|---|
| primes | Lean into the fourth axis: 22 archetypes from irreducible primes; composes with the transversal. | `majors/primes.md` |
| journey | The theme tells a 22-beat story already; narrative-first. | `majors/journey.md` |
| borrowed | The theme contains an existing 22-element set to map onto 1:1. | `majors/borrowed.md` |

## Ranks — Stage 4 (grid axis)

| Method | Best when | File |
|---|---|---|
| questions | Each numbered rank poses a question the suit answers. The default. | `ranks/questions.md` |
| prime_scaffold | Make the fourth axis load-bearing in the ranks; pairs with `majors/primes`. | `ranks/prime_scaffold.md` |
| manual | The theme supplies a native rank progression. | `ranks/manual.md` |

## Pairing notes

- **manual suits often want manual or themed ranks** for tonal consistency; a dialectical grid pairs naturally with `questions`.
- **`majors/primes` pairs with `ranks/prime_scaffold`** if you want the fourth axis visible at both scales.
- **The transversal composes with any of the above** — it is a substrate the others express, not a sibling that competes with them. So is the numeric axis: present regardless, glossed on every major (and optionally each rank) — leaned on hard under the prime strategies, noted briefly or skipped otherwise.
