# The Numeric Axis (Prime / Composite)

The fourth axis. It is not woven into the deck's space like suit, rank, and station — it is *intrinsic* to each card's number. Every card has a number (majors 0–21, minors 1–14), every number has a factorization, and that factorization gives the card a character. The factorization is a pure function of `card.number` — derived, not the thing you store. But its **gloss** — what that character *means for this card* — is an integration, and like every integration it is **authored and stored** (`card.factorization.gloss`). It is the **fourth quantum number**: usually a quiet undertone, occasionally the thing that makes a configuration cohere, and — the v2 change — **a quality signal**. A gloss that won't follow from the factors is telling you the slot is miscast.

## The characters

A card's number is one of:

- **Identity** — 0 (additive: the void/precondition) or 1 (multiplicative: the unit of agency, the transparent operator). Minors have 1 (Ace); majors have both.
- **Prime** — irreducible. It cannot be factored; it simply *is*. An atomic energy.
  - Majors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.
  - Minors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
- **Composite** — derived; a product of primes. Its character emerges from its factors.
  - Powers intensify/transform: x² stabilizes (structure), x³ deep mastery or excess, x⁴ collapse/breakthrough.
  - Products combine: x×y asks "what happens when energy X meets energy Y?"
  - Majors: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21. Minors: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14.

The full major factor table and interpretive frames are in `references/tarot_structure.md`. This axis *is* that structure, lifted out of the majors and recognized as present everywhere a number is.

## Where the gloss lives

The gloss is stored **only where the number is originated** — not on every card. A number lives in exactly two places: a **major's position** (0–21, unique to that trump) and a **rank's value** (1–14, shared by all four suits at that rank). So:

- **Majors carry it, per card** (`MajorArcanaCard.factorization`, required). A trump's number is its own; the gloss has nowhere else to live, and the prime structure is *about* the trumps.
- **Ranks may carry it, once** (`Rank.factorization`, optional). A minor's number is its rank's, so its gloss — if worth authoring — belongs on the rank, shared across the four suits. This is load-bearing under `ranks/prime_scaffold` and usually skipped otherwise (the suits do the minors' structural work; a per-rank number-gloss is rarely an interesting source).
- **Minor cards carry nothing.** Their character is recovered by reference to their rank. Glossing all 56 would just denormalize 14 rank-level facts fourfold.

Each `factorization` block has three fields: **`character`** (`identity|prime|composite`, derived), **`factors`** (the prime factorization for composites — `[2,2]` for 4, `[2,7]` for 14 — derived, stored for legibility), and **`gloss`** (the authored part: one or two sentences on what the character means here). The factorization is arithmetic; the gloss is interpretation — and interpretation is the part worth storing.

## Writing the gloss

- **Identity 0** — the additive identity, the void/precondition. Gloss: what "nothing yet, the ground before differentiation" *is* for this card.
- **Identity 1** — the multiplicative identity, the transparent operator. Gloss: what "the pure unit of agency" is here.
- **Prime** — irreducible. Gloss: *why this energy doesn't decompose* — name the atomic experience and then stop. Resist over-glossing a prime; its whole point is that it simply *is*.
- **Composite** — derived. The gloss leans on the factor-**cards**, not just the numbers:
  - **x²** — the base card *stabilized / structured into a frame*: "Major 2 (The Two Moons) squared — the threshold made permanent."
  - **x³** — the base *compounded into mastery or its shadow (excess, being consumed)*.
  - **x⁴** — the base *concentrated past containment* — collapse, breakthrough, shattering.
  - **x × y** — *what happens when energy X meets energy Y*: name both factor-cards and the quality of their meeting. (`x²·y`: the first is structured, the second acts on it. `x·y²`: the second is fulfilled, the first witnesses it.)

  On a **major** the factors are the majors at those factors (Major 6 = Major 2 × Major 3); on a **rank** (if you gloss it) they are the ranks (rank 6 = the 2-rank meeting the 3-rank).

## The gloss as signal — read this

The gloss is not a field to fill mechanically. **If you cannot write a gloss that genuinely follows from the factors, that is information.** A composite whose meaning doesn't read as its factor-cards meeting — or a prime whose card decomposes too easily into parts — is telling you one of two things:

1. **The card chosen for this slot is wrong.** Under `strategies/majors/primes.md` especially, a composite slot's identity is *supposed* to derive from its factorization; if it won't, you have probably named the wrong archetype for that number.
2. **A factor-card is mis-defined.** When the load-bearing 2 or 3 is off, everything built on it strains, and the strain shows up first as composites whose glosses won't close.

Treat a forced gloss as a flag to **revise the slot or its factors** — not as something to write around. Most of the value of baking this axis in is this early-warning signal; a deck where every gloss closes cleanly is a deck whose numbers and meanings agree.

## Resonance with the transversal

The numeric axis and the transversal are **siblings** — both cross-cut the suit×rank grid — but with different rhythms. The transversal is **periodic** (the station cycles with period N as you walk). The numeric axis is **arithmetic / aperiodic** (primes cluster early, thin late, recur by no fixed beat). Walk the cards and the two drift in and out of phase; their interference is the "oscillating resonance."

Two phenomena worth noticing (and worth folding into the gloss when present):

- **Reinforcement — "extra prime."** When a card is *numerically* prime **and** *transversally* prime (its station sits at a prime index in the canonical order), both cross-cutting structures say "irreducible" at once. The card is doubly-atomic — the deck's most elemental. Lean into irreducibility hard, and let the gloss note it.
- **Tension — crossing.** When a composite number lands on a prime-position station (or a prime on a composite-position station), the two structures disagree about how reducible the card is. That productive dissonance is a reading: a derived thing wearing an atomic key signature, or vice versa.

This resonance is a *soft* tool. The transversal's prime positions are just the prime indices of its order; you needn't compute them precisely to feel it, and you should not let arithmetic override a card's meaning.

## Generating *with* it vs. *noticing* it

- **Generating with it** (`strategies/majors/primes.md`, `strategies/ranks/prime_scaffold.md`): the archetype is *built from* the factorization, so the gloss almost writes itself and the signal is sharpest — a slot that resists a clean gloss is a slot to reconsider then and there.
- **Noticing it** (`journey.md`/`borrowed.md` majors, `questions.md`/`manual.md` ranks): the card was built another way, but the number is still there. A **major** still earns its gloss — terse is fine ("prime — an irreducible beat in the journey") — and a number that flatly contradicts the trump is still worth a second look. A **rank** built this way will usually skip the optional gloss; author it only if it genuinely clarifies.

So: **every major carries a `factorization.gloss`**; a **rank** carries one only when it's load-bearing (chiefly `prime_scaffold`); **minor cards carry none.**
