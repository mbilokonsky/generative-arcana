# Generative Arcana Schema

The JSON shape of a finished deck. One principle governs it: **atomic at write, derived at read.** Every axis's contribution is stored once; a card stores only slugs plus the things it originates — its integrated meaning and its integrated visual description (a **major** additionally carries a factorization gloss; see below).

## Why this schema looks the way it does

A card is an integration over four axes. Three are stored entities the card references by slug (suit, rank, station); the fourth (prime/composite) is derived from the number, and its *gloss* is stored only where the number is originated. So:

- **Suit, rank, and station live once.** A card points at them by slug and never copies their `visual_style`, `visual_content`, or `visual_motif`. Those are reachable by reference at the point of use.
- **A card stores `meaning` (integrated) and `visuals.detailed_description` (integrated);** a major also stores `factorization.gloss`. Plus optional `style`/`content` overrides, present only on deviation.
- **The prime/composite gloss is stored only where the number is originated.** The factorization is always derived from the number. The *gloss* (what the factorization means) is authored — but a **minor's** number is its **rank's** value (1–14), shared by all four suits at that rank, so the gloss, if authored, lives on the `Rank` (once) and minor cards derive their character by reference. A **major's** number (0–21) is unique to the card with no rank to hold it, so its gloss lives on `MajorArcanaCard.factorization.gloss` and is **required**. Glossing every minor card would be denormalization. See `references/numeric_axis.md`.

## The walk

The transversal touches every card, so station assignment is **deterministic and structural** — no configured anchor. The suit order (`Suit.index`) and rank order (`Rank.index`) fix it. Let `N` = number of stations (indexed `0 … N-1` in canonical order) and `k = transversal.suit_stride` (default 1).

- **Minor walk** — `station_index = (rank.index + k · suit.index) mod N`. Origin: the first suit's Ace (suit 0, rank 0) → station 0.
- **Major walk** — a *separate* walk. `station_index = major_number mod N`. Origin: Major 0 → station 0.

Resolve each `station_index` to a `station_slug` via the canonical order and write it to the card. (Materialized for self-description and querying, though recoverable from structure.)

**Why `k`, and why not a plain continuous count.** Laying the 56 minors out as contiguous 14-rank suits and walking `station = (14·suit + rank) mod N` looks continuous and clean, but when `N` divides 14 — which the classic **7** does — it collapses: `14·suit ≡ 0 (mod 7)`, so `station = rank mod N`, identical in every suit, and the axis stops cross-cutting entirely. The escape is a per-suit kick `k` **coprime to N** (the suit stride): each suit's walk is shifted, so no two suits share a pattern. The major walk needs no kick: 22 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so a plain count never realigns.

**Choosing `k` — the fold.** `k` is the *chord* the four suits strike through the qualitative cycle. At a fixed rank they occupy `{r, r+k, r+2k, r+3k} mod N`: `k = 1` packs them onto four adjacent stations (a *close voicing* — suit-neighbors are quality-neighbors); larger `k` spreads them around the ring (an *open voicing* — adjacent suits draw on distant qualities), folding the grid-to-cycle map more and widening the surface for cross-suit correspondence. The choice is **N-relative** — you cannot hardcode a stride:

- **Valid** iff `k` is coprime to `N` (else the four suits collapse onto fewer than four distinct stations; e.g. N = 6, k = 3 gives only two). `k` and `N−k` are mirror images, so the real choices are the coprime `k` in `1 … ⌊N/2⌋`.
- **Default `k = 1`** — the cleanest, most legible diagonal. This is the explicit version of what traditional tarot achieves implicitly by scattering each suit across three non-adjacent zodiac triplicities (see `references/tarot_structure.md`).
- **To unfold**, climb toward `⌊N/2⌋` for more fold; the maximal fold is the largest coprime ≤ `⌊N/2⌋`. For N = 7 the ladder is 1 → 2 → 3; N = 5 is 1 → 2; N = 9 is 1 → 2 → 4 (3 drops out — shared factor). Unfold when the theme wants denser correspondence and can carry the reduced legibility.

## Field notes

**Suits are ordered.** `Suit.index` 0–3 is load-bearing: the minor walk reads it. Keep `suits` keyed by slug but treat `index` as the source of truth for order.

**Meaning palettes vs. integrated meaning.** Axes carry *lists* (a 3–6 sense palette, deliberately unreduced). A card carries *prose* (the synthesis). List = atom; prose = integration. See `integration.md`.

**Overrides, not guidance.** No per-card `style_guidance`/`content_guidance` copies. A card writes only the *delta* into `style_override`/`content_override`, or leaves them unset to inherit from its axis.

**station_slug is the only *textual* mark the transversal leaves on a card.** No per-card station prose — that would re-denormalize and foreground the sublimated axis. The station reaches the card through the integration pass; the slug exists so cross-cutting families stay queryable. (A station's optional `symbol` may surface on a card face by deliberate exception — see `references/svg_symbols.md` — but that is a visual choice in the `detailed_description`, never stored station text on the card.)

**The prime/composite gloss lives on the major (and optionally the rank), never on a minor card.** The factorization is always derived from the number. The authored *gloss* is stored only where the number is originated: on each **major** (`MajorArcanaCard.factorization.gloss`, required — the trumps are the prime structure's home), and optionally **once per rank** (`Rank.factorization`, mainly under `ranks/prime_scaffold`; usually not worth authoring otherwise). A **minor card stores no factorization** — its character is its rank's, recovered by reference. The gloss is authored like `meaning` and can be done well or badly: one that won't follow from the factors is a generative signal, not a field to fill mechanically. See `references/numeric_axis.md`.

**Canonical card order is derived, not key order.** `cards` stays keyed by slug for O(1) lookup, and is emitted in canonical order (22 majors by number, then minors by suit then rank). But consumers that need the order — anything that sorts, paginates, or references a card by position — must *derive* it (majors first by `number`; minors by `suit.index` then `rank.index`), not rely on JSON object key order, which no spec guarantees.

**Majors carry no rank.** A major's `number` is its position 0–21; its meaning and visuals come straight from the chosen `strategies/majors/` method, integrated with `major_arcana.visual_style` (declared), its `station_slug` (sublimated), and its prime character (latent).

**Naming.** Numbered ranks: index 0 → "Ace", 1–9 → "Two"…"Ten". Face ranks (index 10–13): the rank's `name`, no "the". Majors: the card's own name.
